Hello @gpriday 

Please disregard my earlier comment above that I mistakenly posted from another username. Here is my quick review of your theme and and found some issues that I wish you to resolve them. In the meantime I am reviewing rest part of your theme and will come up with more feedbacks if any exists.


= REQUIRED = 

== code ==

- Use escape function on attributes e.g. line 33 and 34 of `header.php` ; line 14 of `footer.php` . Also verify similar case on other files as well . [REQUIRED]
- Please prefix theme functions, classes, global variables, image size name, script and style handles, etc with theme slug. It is missing on `functions.php` line 8,9 ; footer.php line no. 20 etc. Please check on other files too. http://themereview.co/prefix-all-the-things/ 


== files ==

- Specifically document the purpose of this file `woocommerce.php` in your theme. Current documentation defines it as a default page.
- Only commented code found on this file `rtl.css`, looks like your theme does not support RTL .If so, please remove it. 
- Also maintain the changelog.txt file separately as per theme standard

= RECOMMENDED = 
- Use hyphne instead of underscore on Jquery handler. For reference `customizer.php` line 24 etc.

== Theme Check ===
- RECOMMENDED: No reference to add_theme_support( "custom-header", $args ) was found in the theme. It is recommended that the theme implement this functionality if using an image for the header.
- RECOMMENDED: No reference to add_editor_style() was found in the theme. It is recommended that the theme implement editor styling, so as to make the editor content match the resulting post output in the theme, for a better user experience.
- RECOMMENDED: Theme URI: is missing from your style.css header.
- RECOMMENDED: Non-printable characters were found in the settings.php file. You may want to check this file for errors. Line 289: $defaults['footer_text'] = __('Copyright ï¿½ï¿½ {year} {sitename}', 'siteorigin-north');
- RECOMMENDED: More than one text-domain is being used in this theme. This means the theme will not be compatible with WordPress.org language packs. The domains found are siteorigin-north, siteorigin-widgets
