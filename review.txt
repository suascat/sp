= REQUIRED = 

== code ==

- As considered good practice of using standard files, please make a separate file form search form and use `get_search_form()` to call that file on theme. For reference `header.php` line 71. https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_search_form
- Use escape function on attributes e.g. line 33 and 34 of `header.php` ; line 14 of `footer.php` . Also verify similar case on other files as well .
- Please prefix theme functions, classes, global variables, image size name, script and style handles, etc with theme slug. It is missing on `functions.php` line 8,9 ; footer.php line no. 20 etc. Please check on other files too. http://themereview.co/prefix-all-the-things/ 


== files ==

- Document this file `woocommerce.php` properly so as to know its purpose in your theme. Current documentation defines it as a default page.
- Only commented code found on this file `rtl.css`, looks like your theme does not support RTL .If so, please remove it. 
- Also maintain all your changelog in the changelog.txt file separately as per theme standard

= RECOMMENDED = 
- Use hyphne instead of underscore on Jquery handler. For reference `customizer.php` line 24 etc.

== Theme Check ===
